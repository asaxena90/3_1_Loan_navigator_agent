# Loan Navigator Agent Suite  
### *AI-Powered Multi-Agent Support System for Fintech Loan Operations*

**Loan Navigator Agent Suite** is an **agentic AI application** built for *BlueLoans4all*, a micro-lending fintech platform, to automate and streamline customer loan support queries.  
Powered by **Google Vertex AI (Gemini Models)** and orchestrated using **LangGraph**, the system simulates an intelligent financial support desk that answers EMI, prepayment, and policy-related questions—accurately, securely, and in real-time.

---
## Overview

In India’s fast-growing fintech ecosystem, support centers face repetitive and compliance-critical loan queries.  
This project introduces a **multi-agent AI system** that combines **natural language understanding**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **financial simulation** capabilities — hosted and monitored entirely on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

## Key Features

| Agent | Role | Core Function |
|--------|------|----------------|
|**Supervisor Agent** | Orchestrator | Classifies intent, routes queries, merges results |
|**SQL Analyst Agent** | Data Retrieval | Converts NL → SQL and fetches loan data securely |
|**Policy Guru Agent** | Compliance/RAG | Retrieves RBI & internal policy info with citations |
|**What-If Calculator Agent** | Simulation | Runs EMI & prepayment scenario calculations |

## Core Capabilities

- **Natural Language to SQL** – Converts customer questions like *“What’s my next EMI?”* into parameterized SQL queries.
- **RAG-based Policy Lookup** – Fetches and cites RBI guidelines or internal policies from a vector DB.
- **What-if Simulations** – Computes prepayment, tenure change, and EMI adjustments dynamically.
- **Autonomous Orchestration** – Supervisor coordinates multiple agents to deliver unified, compliant answers.
- **Audit & Traceability** – All interactions logged via Langfuse/MLflow for transparency and compliance.

## Deployment

### Local Development

Update .env file in local environment folder

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY="your key"
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=bdc-trainings
GCP_REGION="us-central1"
GCP_PROJECT="bdc-training"

TAVILY_API_KEY="your key"
LOAN_DB_BUCKET="loan-navigator-data-3-1"
LOAN_DB_BLOB="LoanDB_BlueLoans4all.sqlite"

VERTEX_AI_MODEL="gemini-2.0-flash"
CHROMA_URL="https://chroma-service-xxxx.a.run.app"
```

### 1. Build Container

```bash
docker build -t loan-navigator .
```

### 2. Push to Artifact Registry

``` bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/loan-navigator
```

### 3. Deploy to Cloud Run

``` bash
gcloud run deploy loan-navigator \
  --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/loan-navigator \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

## API Endpoint

POST /ask

### Request:

``` json
{ "query": "Can I prepay my loan early?" }
```

### Response:

``` json
{
  "response": {
    "answer": "Yes, your loan is eligible for prepayment with no penalties as per policy 4.3.1.",
    "citations": ["policy_loan_prepayment.pdf#page=3"]
  }
}
```

## Monitoring & Feedback Loop

- **Langfuse**: Tracks LLM token usage, latency, and fallback triggers.
- **MLflow**: Logs versioned model usage and prompt performance.
- **Google Cloud Operations Suite**: Dashboards for Cloud Run metrics, logs, and alerts.

## Deliverables
